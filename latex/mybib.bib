abstract="We propose a Dynamic-Spatial-Attention (DSA) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for anticipating accidents in dashcam videos (Fig. 1). Our DSA-RNN learns to (1) distribute soft-attention to candidate objects dynamically to gather subtle cues and (2) model the temporal dependencies of all cues to robustly anticipate an accident. Anticipating accidents is much less addressed than anticipating events such as changing a lane, making a turn, etc., since accidents are rare to be observed and can happen in many different ways mostly in a sudden. To overcome these challenges, we (1) utilize state-of-the-art object detector [3] to detect candidate objects, and (2) incorporate full-frame and object-based appearance and motion features in our model. We also harvest a diverse dataset of 678 dashcam accident videos on the web (Fig. 3). The dataset is unique, since various accidents (e.g., a motorbike hits a car, a car hits another car, etc.) occur in all videos. We manually mark the time-location of accidents and use them as supervision to train and evaluate our method. We show that our method anticipates accidents about 2 s before they occur with 80{\%} recall and 56.14{\%} precision. Most importantly, it achieves the highest mean average precision (74.35{\%}) outperforming other baselines without attention or RNN.",

    abstract = { This paper introduces a robust, real-time system for detecting driver lane changes. Under the framework of a “mind-tracking architecture,” the system simulates a set of possible driver intentions and their resulting behaviors using an approximation of a rigorous and validated model of driver behavior. The system compares these simulations with a driver's actual observed behavior, thus inferring the driver's unobservable intentions. The paper demonstrates how this system can detect a driver's intention to change lanes, achieving an accuracy of 85\% with a false alarm rate of 4\%; detecting 80\% of lane changes within 1/2 second and 90\% within 1 second; and detecting 90\% before the vehicle moves 1/4 of the lane width laterally — that is, approximately when the vehicle first touches the destination lane line. }

The main components of the system consists of a specially-designed hardware system for real time image acquisition and for controlling the illuminator and the alarm system, and various computer vision algorithms for real time eye tracking, eye-lid movement monitoring, face pose discrimination, and gaze estimation. Specific contributions include the development of an infrared illuminator to produce the desired bright/dark pupil effect, the development a digital circuitry to perform real time image subtraction, and the development of numerous real time computer vision algorithms for eye tracking, face orientation discrimination, and gaze tracking. The system was tested extensively in a simulating environment with subjects of different ethnic backgrounds, different genders, ages, with/without glasses, and under different illumination conditions, and it was found very robust, reliable and accurate.",

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, driver drowsiness has been one of the major causes of road accidents and can lead to severe physical injuries, deaths and significant economic losses. Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver drowsiness detection system which could alert the driver before a mishap happens. Researchers have attempted to determine driver drowsiness using the following measures: (1) vehicle-based measures; (2) behavioral measures and (3) physiological measures. A detailed review on these measures will provide insight on the present systems, issues associated with them and the enhancements that need to be done to make a robust system. In this paper, we review these three measures as to the sensors used and discuss the advantages and limitations of each. The various ways through which drowsiness has been experimentally manipulated is also discussed. We conclude that by designing a hybrid drowsiness detection system that combines non-intusive physiological measures with other measures one would accurately determine the drowsiness level of a driver. A number of road accidents might then be avoided if an alert is sent to a driver that is deemed drowsy.},
